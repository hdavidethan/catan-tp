CATAN: The Settlers of Python

This project is a python implementation of the popular board game Catan. The game
allows players to add up to 3 other human or AI players. When playing against
other human players, the game is done "hotseat" turn-based style, where each
player takes turns on the same computer. For full immersion, it is recommended
that all players only look at their own hands.

Open the app.py file in the root directory and run in Python 3.
