CATAN: The Settlers of Python

This project is a python implementation of the popular board game Catan. It
allows players to play in two modes: Hotseat or AI.

Hotseat Mode:
Here you can play a classic game of Catan against your friends. Just take turns
on the same computer and avoid peeking at each others' hands to ensure complete
immersion.

AI Mode:
Here you can play singleplayer against 3 AI Players. You just have to observe
the AI's moves and click End Turn.

How to Run the Game?
Open the app.py file in the root directory and run in Python 3.

pip install pygame
